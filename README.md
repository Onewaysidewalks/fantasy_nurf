# Fantasy Urf

Fantasy Urf is a fantasy esports platform (akin to fantasy football) that is focused on giving players the ability to construct their ideal teams, against their friends (or enemies!).

Fantasy Urf takes a slightly different approach to the fantasy sport genre:

- Instead of being focused around **people**, the platform is focused around **champions**!
- In the spirit of the URF game mode, instead of a long and drawn out "season", the matches will be played instantly! More details on this below!

### What does this mean?
It means that you wont be picking professional esport-ers from TSM or Evil Geniuses.

Instead, you as a participant are picking the champions that make up your all-star team! (If you want to play bard as a mid-laner, by all means!)

### How do you play?

1. A player starts by choosing his/her lineup (including bans, and alternatives) for each role.
2. The player then invites another player to play against via a code
3. The other player enters the code, picks his/her lineup, and submits it for Fantasy Urf *Awesomesauce*.
4. Players are notified that their "URF Style season" is complete, and can view the outcome of each match, as well as the overall winner.

### How does it work?

- The URF season in League of Legends (the matches played in the game) have been recorded and have had hourly stats calculated for each champion that was played.
- Fantasy Urf "seasons" consist of three 'games', each tied to an hour of statistics.
- When two players 'play' Fantasy Urf, their respective lineups will battle off, for that season (the three 'games')
- Champion scores for each player will be calculated off of the hour statistics for each game in the season.
- A winner is declared by whoever won the majority of games in the 'season'.
